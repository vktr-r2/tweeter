# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.  Project was primarily focused on introducing us to front-end dynamic websit design using HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation using JQuery.  Secondary focus was on further honing back-end skills with Express, HTTP, and GET/POST requests and responses.
